        <h2>Questions & Answers:</h2>
       <ol>Q: Why does textbook refer to "the Tower of Babel" regarding computer languages?</ol>
       <ol>A:The setting of the story fo Tower of Babel takes place in a time when the everyone on earth spoke one language and everyone spoke the same word. People started to make cities with strong tower and then everyone started to speak in another language and no one could understand each other. They lost communcation and couldn't understand one another and left the tower.</ol>

       <ol>Q:Why isn't there just one computer programming language?</ol>
       <ol>A: there are so many different things you might need to do with computers and many different kinds of computers.</ol>

       <ol>Q:Why didn't FORTRAN use the less than ( < ) symbol when comparing two numbers?</ol>
       <ol>A:Back then the versions of Fortran needed all the variable identifiers to be uppercase. It didn't allow mathematical signs like a "<" to compare two things.</ol>
       <ol>QWhat was COBOL designed for?</ol>
       <ol>A:business computer programs in industries such as finance and human resources.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What was the language, C, designed for?</ol>
       <ol>A:a system implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is the difference between C and C++?</ol>
       <ol>A:C is a structural or procedural programming language that was used for system applications and low-level programming applications. Whereas C++ is an object-oriented programming language having some additional features like Encapsulation, Data Hiding, Data Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.</ol>
       <ol>Q:Who or what is the language, Ada, named for and why?</ol>
       <ol>A:Ada was named for Augusta Ada King, countess of Lovelace, who was an assistant to the 19th-century English inventor Charles Babbage, and is sometimes called the first computer programmer. Ada, the language, was developed in the early 1980s for the U.S. Department of Defense.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is a Java "applet"?</ol>
       <ol>A:An applet is a Java program that runs in a Web browser.</ol>
       <ol>Q:How much does Python cost to download, install, and use?</ol>
       <ol>A:it is free, no charge</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is Microsoft. NET?</ol>
       <ol>A:.NET Framework is used to create and run software applications.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is SQL and what is it used for?</ol>
       <ol>A:Structured query language (SQL) is used to communicate with a database.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is R and what is it used for?</ol>
       <ol>A:R is a universal programming language compatible with the Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, and Linux platforms.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is Go (or golang) and what is it used for?</ol>
       <ol>A:an open source programming language that Google developed.</ol>
       <ol>Q:What is Swift and what is it used for?</ol>
       <ol>A:Swift is a robust and intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. It's designed to give developers more freedom than ever. Swift is easy to use and open source, so anyone with an idea can create something incredible.</ol>
       <h2>Briefly describe each of the following alternative programming paradigms:</h2>
       <ol>
       <li>functional programming</li>
       <dl>an approach to software development that uses pure functions to create maintainable software.</dl>
       <li>logic programming</li>

       <h2>Stack Overflow Q & A:</h2>
       <ol>Q:What is the purpose of Stack Overflow?</ol>
       <ol>A:helps people find the answers they need, when they need them.</ol>
       <ol>Q:How much research effort is expected of Stack Overflow users?</ol>
       <ol>A:They expect a lot, when asking a question in Stack Overflow should be the last step in the process to seek an answer.</ol>
       <ol>Q:Why should I post complete errors? Why isn't the message itself enough?</ol>
       <ol>A:A generic message like "No such file or directory" only says something about the specific error code that was returned, but nothing about where, why or how it happened.The rest of the error message is vital for filling in the gaps. It's especially important to copy-paste everything exactly as it is, because even tiny changes in punctuation provide important information.</ol>
       <ol>Q:Why should I not upload images of code/data/errors?</ol>
       <ol>A:The first reason is that links to images fail. The second reason is that text on images is not searchable. The third reason is that it gives you an incentive 'not to try'; simply show us a screenshot of your code and call it a day.</ol>
       <ol>Q:Why is "Can someone help me?" not an actual question?</ol>
       <ol>A:Stack Overflow is a question & answer site. You may think that you have asked a reasonable, answerable question, but a question like "Can someone help me"? really doesn't qualify. First, a bit of background: The purpose of Stack Overflow is to create a knowledge repository of solutions to programming problems. Its mantra is "Make the Internet a better place". That means that a primary characteristic of a good question is that it is likely to be searched by someone else. "Will you help me do X?" doesn't do that. More than likely, no one will ever be trying to do, and searching for, the exact same thing as you in exactly the same way.</ol>
       <ol>Q:Under what circumstances may I add "urgent" or other similar phrases to my question, in order to obtain faster answers?</ol>
       <ol>A:At best this is extra fluff in your question, which gets in the way of your actual question. This makes it harder for people to help you, which makes it less likely that you'll get an answer. Nobody is going to see that you need an answer ASAP and then drop everything they're doing in order to help you. Your emergencies are your own. Alternatively: lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part. At worst it'll be seen as very rude.</ol>
       <ol>Q:Advice for non-native English speakers</ol>
       <ol>A:If you aren't a native English speaker, here are some rules that can improve some of the reactions to your posts, and also the quality of the answers to your questions.(If you are a native English speaker, you should also be following these rules.)Behind the questions and answers on this site, there is a complex reviewing/moderating mechanism, and your extra efforts can make some of that work significantly easier for the rest of us.</ol>
       <ol>Q:I want to seed Stack Overflow with questions about my product/project. What do I need to know?</ol>
       <ol>A:Can I support my product here?

        <ol>A:Be specific and imagine you’re asking a question to another person.</ol>
        <ol>Q:What are the steps to writing a good Stack Overflow question?</ol>
        <ol>A:Summarize your problem in a one-line title.
            Describe your problem in more detail.
            Describe what you tried and what you expected to happen.

        <h2>Stack Overflow Programming Survery:</h2>
        <ol>Q:How many people answered the 2021 survey?</ol>
        <ol>A:May 2021 over 80,000 developers told us how they learn and level up, which tools they’re using, and what they want.</ol>
        <ol>Q:What were the top three countries where responses came from?</ol>
        <ol>A:Coders start young: over 50% of respondents wrote their first line of code between the ages of 11 to 17.</ol>
        <ol>Q:What were the three most popular ways of learning how to code?</ol>
        <ol>A:It is no surprise that almost 60% of respondents learned how to code from online resources. Younger respondents tend to learn from online courses, forums, and other online resources. Older respondents, on the other hand, learned from more traditional mediums like school and books.</ol>
        <ol>Q:How long have most people been coding?</ol>
        <ol>A:50% of respondents have been coding for ten years or less. Respondents from the United Kingdom, on average, have the most years coding out of our top ten countries.</ol>
        <ol>Q:What percentage of coders identified as male?</ol>
        <ol>A:91% of all respondents and 92% of professional developers identify as a man.</ol>
        <ol>Q:Your opinion: How can the IT community get more women in coding?</ol>
        <ol>A:They should motivate females to try coding. </ol>
        <ol>Q:What were the top three programming languages?</ol>
        <ol>A:Java
            HTML/CSS
            Python</ol>

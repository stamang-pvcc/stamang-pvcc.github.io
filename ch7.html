            <dl>ethernet is the traditional technology for connecting devices in a wired local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN).</dl>
            <li>WLAN</li>
            <dl>WLAN is a wireless distribution method for two or more devices.</dl>
            <li>IEEE 802.11 wireless njketwork standard</li>
            <dl>IEEE is a global association and organization of professionals working toward the development, implementation and maintenance of technology-centered products and services.</dl>
            <li>MAN</li>
            <dl>MAN is a computer network that connects computers within a metropolitan area</dl>
            <li>Internet of Things</li>
            <dl>Internet of things describes the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.</dl>
            <li>LAN</li>
            <dl>LAN consist of a series of computers linked together to form a network in a circumscribed location.</dl>
            <li>repeater</li>  
            <dl>repeater is a network device that retransmits a received signal with more power and to an extended geographical or topological network boundary than what would be capable with the original signal.</dl>
            <li>bridge</li>
            <dl>bridge is a class of network device that's designed to connect networks at OSI Level 2, which is the data link layer of a local-area network (LAN).</dl>
            <li>WAN</li>
            <dl>WAN is a computer network that connects smaller networks</dl>
            <li>packet and packet switching</li>
            <dl>packet and packet switching is the transfer of small pieces of data across various networks</dl>
            <li>ISP</li>  
            <dl>ISP is a company that provides individuals and organizations access to the internet and other related services.</dl>
            <li>firewall</li>
            <dl>firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.</dl>
            <li>protocol</li>
            <dl>protocol is a standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data.</dl>
            <li>cloud computing</li>
            <dl>cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.</dl>
            <li>net neutrality</li>
            <dl>net neutrality is the principle that an internet service provider (ISP) has to provide access to all sites, content and applications at the same speed, under the same conditions without blocking or giving preference to any content.</dl>
                   
        </ol>
        <h2>Briefly describe the five layers of TCP/IP(the internet protocol hierarchy)</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Layer 1.physical layer:The physical layer is the first and lowest layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model. </li>
        <li>Layer 2. Data link layer:The data link layer is the protocol layer in a program that handles the moving of data into and out of a physical link in a network. </li>
        <li>Layer 3. Network layer:The "network layer" is the part of the Internet communications process where these connections occur, by sending packets of data back and forth between different networks. </li>
        <li>Layer 4. Transport layer:The transport layer provides communication between application processes running on different hosts within a layered architecture of protocols and other network components. </li>
        <li>Layer 5. Application layerThe application layer sits at Layer 7, the top of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communications model. It ensures an application can effectively communicate with other applications on different computer systems and networks. </li>
         </ol>

         <h2>List and brifely describe at least 3 network services and benefits:</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>LAN</li>
            <dl>LAN (local area network) their advantages are private ownership, does not cost too much, hardware and software can be shared, etc.</dl>

            <li>MAN</li>
            <dl>The primary advantage of a MAN over a WAN is the high bandwidth enabled by the dedicated links of a metropolitan area network.</dl>
            <li>WAN</li>
            <dl>Wide area network benefits are increase efficiency, easy of communicatipm, large network cover, boost your privacy, etc.</dl>
         </ol>

        <h2>Three misconceptions about Computer Science:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You have to be good at math to succeed in computer science.</li>
            <li>computer science is all about coding</li>
            <li>Learning computer science is more difficult than learning subjects in business and managment.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Briefly define:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Computer Science</li>
            <p>The study of computers and computational systemns.</p>
            
            <li>Algorithm</li>
            <p>A algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem step-by-step to accomplish a task</p>
            
            <li>Sequential Operation</li>
            <p>Sequential Operation is a sequence of instructions that caries out a single well defined task then when that task is finished it moves on to the next one. </p>
            
            <li>Conditional Operation</li>
            <p>Conditional Operation is "question-asking set of instructions because they ask questions and it moves foward baised on the input.</p>
            <li>Iterative Operation</li>
            <p>Iterative Operation unlike the other operation repeats a set of instructions until it gets the value that has been set.</p>
            
            <li>Store Program Computer</li>
            <p>A computer that stores instructions in its memory to enable it to preform a varity of tasks in a sequence or intermittently. </p>A 
            <li>Programmer</li>
            <p>A person who writes, modfies, and tests code that allows computer software and applications to function properly.</p>
            <li>Integrated Circuit</li>
            <p>A chip with thouands or millions of tiny resistors, capacitros, diodes, and transistors that is able to function as many things like a timer, counter, logic gate, or even computer memory. </p>
        </ol>

        <h2>Briefly describe these computer generations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First generation computer</li>
            <p>The first generation computers came about in 1940-1956. The computers would take up entire rooms as it was a huge computer, would be expensive to operate, and cost a lot of electriy to run.
                The first computer system used vacuum but the downside would be computer generated a lot of heat and it would take up an entire building.
            </p> 
            <li>Second generation computer</li>
           <p> The second generation came in 1956-1963, while the first generation computers used vacuums the second generation computers used transistors. This made computers more smaller, faster, and cheaper. One of the downside is it still requires punch card for input and output. </p>
            <li>Third generation computer</li>
            <p> The third generation came of 1964-1971. They developed the integrated circut which was a greaat achievment at the time. With the third generation came about evem more smaller and cheaper computers that so lower class people can afford. </p>
            <li>Fourth generation computer</li>
            <p> Fourth generation came about 1971-present. The microprocessor became big because you could hold an entire first generation computer in the palm of your hands.</p>
            <li>Fifth generation computer</li>
            <p> The fifth generation is present and beyond. It has artifical intelligence like voice recognition that are used to this day. The goal of the fifth generation is to make devices that will respond to natural language and be able to learn and be self organized. </p>
        </ol>
        <h5>FORTRAN:</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>What does  the acronym FORTRAN stand for?</li>
            <p>The acrnoym FORTRAN stands for......</p>

            <li>authorization</li>
            <dl>The process of verifying that a requested action or service is approved for a specific entity</dl>

            <li>dual authentication</li>
            <dl>an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps.</dl>
            <li>social engineering</li>
            <dl>all techniques aimed at talking a target into revealing specific information or performing a specific action for illegitimate reasons.</dl>
            <li>virus</li>
            <dl> a type of malicious software, or malware, that spreads between computers and causes damage to data and software.</dl>
            <li>worm</li>
            <dl>a type of malware whose primary function is to self-replicate and infect other computers while remaining active on infected systems</dl>
            <li>Trojan horse</li>
            <dl>a type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program</dl>
            <li>ransomware</li>
            <dl>a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them unusable.</dl>
            <li>phishing</li>
            <dl>an attempt to trick victims into. sharing sensitive information such as passwords, usernames, and credit card details for malicious reasons.</dl>
            <li>White Hat</li>
            <dl>a computer hacker who is hired by an organization to undertake nonmalicious hacking work in order to discover computer-security flaws.</dl>

            <li>encryption/decryption</li>
            <dl>Encrypted secrets allow you to store sensitive information in your organization, repository, or repository environments. What is Decryption. Definition: The conversion of encrypted data into its original form</dl>
            <li>cryptography</li>
            <dl>the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.</dl>
            <li>symmetric encryption algorithm</li>
            <dl>uses one key to encrypt and decrypt</dl>
            <li>Caesar cipher</li>
            <dl>a shift cipher and encrypts the data by replacing the original letters with “x” number of characters ahead in the alphabet.</dl>
            <li>block cipher</li>
            <dl>a method of encrypting data in blocks to produce ciphertext using a cryptographic key and algorithm.</dl>
            <li>Data Encryption Standard (DES)</li>  
            <dl> a block cipher, meaning a cryptographic key and algorithm are applied to a block of data simultaneously rather than one bit at a time. </dl>
            <li>public key system</li>
            <dl>a method of encrypting or signing data with two different keys and making one of the keys, the public key, available for anyone to use.</dl>
